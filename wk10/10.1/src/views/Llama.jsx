            <p>
                Lamoids, or llamas (as they are more generally known as a group), consist of the vicuña (Vicugna vicugna, prev. Lama
                vicugna), guanaco (Lama guanicoe), Suri alpaca, and Huacaya alpaca (Vicugna pacos, prev. Lama guanicoe pacos), and the
                domestic llama (Lama glama). Guanacos and vicuñas live in the wild, while llamas and alpacas exist only as
                domesticated animals. Although early writers compared llamas to sheep, their similarity to the camel was soon recognized. They
                were included in the genus Camelus along with alpaca in the Systema Naturae (1758) of Carl Linnaeus. They were,
                however, separated by Georges Cuvier in 1800 under the name of lama along with the guanaco. DNA analysis has
                confirmed that the guanaco is the wild ancestor of the llama, while the vicuña is the wild ancestor of the alpaca; the
                latter two were placed in the genus Vicugna.

            <p>
                The genera Lama and Vicugna are, with the two species of true camels, the sole existing representatives of a very
                distinct section of the Artiodactyla or even-toed ungulates, called Tylopoda, or &quot;bump-footed&quot;, from the peculiar
                bumps on the soles of their feet. The Tylopoda consist of a single family, the Camelidae, and shares the order Artiodactyla
                with the Suina (pigs), the Tragulina (chevrotains), the Pecora (ruminants), and the Whippomorpha (hippos and
                cetaceans, which belong to Artiodactyla from a cladistic, if not traditional, standpoint). The Tylopoda have more or less
                affinity to each of the sister taxa, standing in some respects in a middle position between them, sharing some characteristics
                from each, but in others showing special modifications not found in any of the other taxa.

                The 19th-century discoveries of a vast and previously unexpected extinct Paleogene fauna of North America, as
                interpreted by paleontologists Joseph Leidy, Edward Drinker Cope, and Othniel Charles Marsh, aided understanding of
                the early history of this family.] Llamas were not always confined to South America; abundant llama-like
                remains were found in Pleistocene deposits in the Rocky Mountains and in Central America. Some of the fossil llamas
                were much larger than current forms. Some species remained in North America during the last ice ages. North American llamas
                are categorized as a single extinct genus, Hemiauchenia. Llama-like animals would have been a common sight 25,000
                years ago, in modern-day California, Texas, New Mexico, Utah, Missouri, and Florida.

                The camelid lineage has a good fossil record. Camel-like animals have been traced from the thoroughly differentiated,
                modern species back through early Miocene forms. Their characteristics became more general, and they lost those that
                distinguished them as camelids; hence, they were classified as ancestral artiodactyls. No fossils of these earlier
                forms have been found in the Old World, indicating that North America was the original home of camelids, and that the
                ancestors of Old World camels crossed over via the Bering Land Bridge from North America. The formation of the Isthmus
                of Panama three million years ago allowed camelids to spread to South America as part of the Great American
                Interchange, where they evolved further. Meanwhile, North American camelids died out at the end of the Pleistocene.
